## Frequently Asked Questions

**1. Why open source the optimizations for MySQL?**

Performance optimization is a complex process, and different operating environments can yield varying results. Therefore, optimizing MySQL requires a diverse set of testing environments, as relying solely on official mechanisms often leads to suboptimal outcomes. By leveraging enhancements in official features, secondary optimizations can be performed at a lower cost, allowing for a more focused approach to maximizing MySQL's potential.

While these optimizations may be lower in priority within the official MySQL version, they usually incur minimal costs and involve limited code changes. Such optimizations can significantly enhance user experience, and the maintenance costs are relatively low, making them well worth implementing.



**2. Why choose this open-source approach, releasing a new version following the official higher versions?**

When users opt for a specific version and find it inconvenient to upgrade alongside official releases, our open-source version becomes the ideal choice. Each open-source version will be maintained, with critical bugs fixed and performance enhanced. Since many optimizations and bug fixes are applicable across different versions, maintaining the 8.0 series is straightforward, and support for stable releases of higher versions will continue in the future.

To date, MySQL 8.0 has been in development and use for over eight years, demonstrating its reliability and establishing it as a trusted version. i



**3. Why do users report a performance decline in 8.0?**

Many users claim that the performance of 8.0 has declined, but this is a misconception, often based on single-node sysbench test results. Users should test our open-source version in real-world environments or use better tools like BenchmarkSQL TPCC to evaluate the optimized performance, ideally testing in a clustered environment.

The feedback on performance decline mostly comes from tests on low-end machines. The reason for the decline in these environments is that the official version uses a new redo log mechanism, which indeed has higher latency compared to the previous one. However, this new mechanism greatly improves concurrent write capabilities, allowing 8.0 to outperform version 5.7 significantly in high-concurrency scenarios.

We have optimized for low-concurrency environments, achieving notable improvements in some cases, though these improvements are only significant in specific scenarios.



**4. What is the logic behind the modifications for high availability?**

The official Group Replication is overly complex, significantly hindering further improvements. The less effective multi-write mechanism and strong consistency write mechanism have been removed, along with the single leader Paxos approach from the underlying communication. Optimizations to the data structure for Paxos communication have reduced network overhead, and performance in the original multi-leader Paxos algorithm has been improved, closely following the principles outlined in the research paper.

At the upper layer of Group Replication, the elimination of the conflict detection mechanism has led to substantial improvements in write performance. In 99.99% of scenarios, the relay log write is no longer a bottleneck.

Looking ahead, persistent storage for Paxos messages will be implemented to ensure data integrity while maintaining high availability performance.



**5. What is the logic behind the modifications for replica replay?**

The replay speed of MySQL replicas has been improved, including acceleration of large transaction replays and resolution of significant performance degradation issues in NUMA environments. A new scheduling mechanism for SQL threads has been adopted, addressing deficiencies in the official scheduling, minimizing waiting times for scheduling threads, and fully leveraging the potential of SQL thread scheduling. For binlogs based on writesets, replicas can achieve significantly improved replay speeds in high-performance environments.

Additionally, the replay speed of replicas is closely linked to memory allocation. Utilizing advanced memory allocation tools and disabling the performance schema, along with the dual configuration of `sync_binlog=1` and `innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=1`, can significantly enhance replica replay speeds.



**6. In which environments do our optimizations perform outstandingly?**

The optimized version significantly outperforms the official release in most online environments, particularly in NUMA scenarios, and is well ahead of version 5.7. For detailed information, please refer to [out book](https://advancedmysql.github.io/The-Art-of-Problem-Solving-in-Software-Engineering_How-to-Make-MySQL-Better/).



**7. How can consistency be ensured when reading data from replicas?**

This issue can be divided into two scenarios: 

In the first scenario, within a high availability setup, the 'before' mechanism ensures that the latest data is read. This mechanism operates as follows: when reading from the replica, the latest GTID is obtained via the Paxos protocol, and the read occurs only after the transaction with that GTID is committed. Since transaction commits from the replica follow the 'replica preserve commit order' mechanism, all prior transactions will have been executed by the time the user initiates the read request, allowing for the retrieval of the latest data. Given the significant improvements in replica replay speed, this waiting cost is generally minimal. In scenarios requiring strong consistency reads, configuring the 'before' setting on the replica can satisfy user needs, typically resulting in only millisecond-level costs (Paxos communication cost + wait GTID cost).

If the high availability mechanism is not employed, users can still perform read operations through MySQL middleware or by including GTIDs, which will also allow access to the latest data.



**8. When is Paxos log persistence expected to be open-sourced?**

It is expected to be open-sourced around the end of the year.



**9. What are the core advantages of MySQL 8.0 over 5.7?**

In addition to enhanced features, MySQL 8.0 emphasizes high-concurrency performance. During its development, the official team made significant improvements, prioritizing scalability at the expense of some low-concurrency performance. To fully appreciate the benefits of our enhancements in 8.0, high-performance machines, particularly those with NUMA architecture, are essential. To effectively support over 1,000 concurrent connections, a throttling mechanism may be required, and there are plans to gradually open-source this functionality.



**10. Why does the released version include PGO optimization?**

For medium-end machines, performance can typically be enhanced through PGO optimization. However, implementing PGO optimization requires addressing scalability issues, which is why it is infrequently utilized. The release version incorporates PGO optimization, alleviating concerns about throughput reduction across various environments. Performance remains robust for concurrent connections below 1,000.



**11. Why are performance issues difficult to detect in low concurrency and weak environments?**

In low-concurrency and weak machine environments, performance issues often go unnoticed. These setups typically use SMP architecture, where NUMA-related problems are not apparent. With low concurrency, latch contention is minimal, and IO becomes the primary bottleneck, while limited CPU resources increase optimization costs. Consequently, identifying performance issues poses a challenge for MySQL developers. For example, in weak machines limited by IO, Amdahl's Law indicates that the computational portion is small, making optimization effects less noticeable. In contrast, high IO environments have a significant computational portion, leading to more pronounced optimization benefits.



**12. What value does our open-source project provide in high-end environments?**

In high IO speed environments, our open-source project delivers substantial value. It not only tackles NUMA-related issues in MySQL's primary but also enhances those in replicas. By significantly alleviating the scalability challenges of the InnoDB storage engine, optimizations like PGO can be realized more effectively.



**13. What value does our optimized version provide in medium-end environments (such as a single NUMA node or SMP environment)?**

First, the optimizations address group replication issues, making them suitable for both high-end and low-end machine scenarios. Second, the replay speed of replicas can be improved, ensuring that consistency reads remain unaffected. Finally, the effectiveness of PGO is significantly enhanced in these environments.



**14. What value does our optimization provide in low-end environments (such as weak IO devices, virtual machine environments, and few CPUs)?**

The effectiveness largely depends on the specific environment. While our redo log optimization can yield positive results in some cases, extensive testing indicates that improvements are not guaranteed. Although latency can be reduced to some extent, the effects may not match those seen in high-end machines. However, a robust high availability mechanism can still be leveraged.



**15. Why do we place such importance on high concurrency capabilities?**

In cross-datacenter scenarios, high availability clusters must support high concurrency. Additionally, online environments often include thinking time, further emphasizing the need for high concurrency. Amdahl's Law indicates that in synchronous cluster environments, network latency is a significant factor, which means the benefits of single-machine optimizations may not translate effectively to clusters. This highlights the essential difference between cluster testing and MySQL single-machine performance. Thus, testing environments should closely mirror online environments to ensure the authenticity of the results.



**16. How do we merge the official code in our open-source project?**

Work is based on the officially released version, with patches applied accordingly. During code conflict resolution, logical consistency is ensured, followed by regression testing. Once regression tests are successful, extensive testing across various types is conducted to confirm the program's integrity.

This merging strategy is highly efficient for MySQL 8.0 and later versions, allowing for seamless alignment with official updates to MySQL 8.0.



**17. Why aren't these improvements merged into the official MySQL?**

Optimizations have been recommended to the official team and have received acknowledgment. However, they are assigned low priority in official bug fixes. Simple optimizations may take considerable time to be integrated, while complex ones might never be implemented.

As a result, the decision was made to open-source the MySQL optimized version to ensure effective application in high-end scenarios.



**18. Why not develop based on Percona?**

First, the merging process with Percona is notably slow.
Second, as MySQL's scalability issues are progressively resolved, solutions based on the Percona thread pool often do not yield significant performance enhancements in most scenarios. In contrast, throttling mechanisms provide a more effective means of stabilizing throughput under extremely high concurrency.
Finally, while Percona mainly emphasizes operational strategies, our approach is fundamentally focused on performance optimization.
